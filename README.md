Chapter 1 - Day 2
1. What are the 5 Cadence Programming Language Pillars?

        safety and security, clarity, approachability, developer experience, resource oriented programming

2. In your opinion, even without knowing anything about the Blockchain or coding, why could the 5 Pillars be useful?

        for someone new to something that costs money safety and security are likely their number one concerns 
        so it's important that a technology be safe and secure to ensure a smooth onboarding experience. having 
        code that is readable and familiar makes sense because it's also efficient and helps people build together 
        and grow faster.
